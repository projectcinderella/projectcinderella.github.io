Once upon a time in a faraway place, lived a kind and gentle young woman called Cinderella Chia Chey Hui. Chey, as she was called, served as a maid in her own château. Her daily chores includes chasing after the undisciplined ~~CFO’s~~ rats, ensuring the lazy ~~colleagues~~ gnomes stick to their deadlines and rejecting the greedy ~~departments~~ leprechauns application for extra money, often coming home very, very tired at the end of the day. Although still a young woman, she felt older than her years. And then the fairy godmother appeared, promising to granting her a wish if she could have 1,000 birthday wishes before the clock strikes 12 on her birthday this year...


## Cinderella, as seen from the lens of her 7 friends:

> _She_ don’t care what they’re going to say. Let the storm rage on. The cold never bothered _her_ anyway.

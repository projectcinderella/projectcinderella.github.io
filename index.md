Once upon a time in a faraway place ~~OMB~~, lived a kind and gentle young woman called Cinderella Chia Chey Hui. Chey, as she was called, served as a maiden in a large château ~~NTUC~~. Her daily chores include chasing after the undisciplined ~~colleagues~~ mice, ensuring the irresponsible ~~project managers~~ gnomes stick to their deadlines and rejecting the greedy ~~departments~~ leprechauns' application for extra money, often coming home very, very tired at the end of the day. Although still a young woman, she felt older than her years. And then the fairy godmother appeared, promising to grant her a wish if she could have 28 birthday wishes before the clock strikes 12 on her birthday this year...

## 7 Songs for Cinderella:

#### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcinderella/projectcinderella.github.io/master/assets/images/Zen 1.jpg" alt="Example" width="80" height="80"> Cool head - Warm heart
She makes people around her feel calm and she is composed despite all the **牛鬼蛇神**. With her guidance, we **take control** in whatever space that we operate in, no matter in the middle of the highway or in a meeting with the most difficult person on earth. Her frequently used encouragement to herself and us, **ZEN!!!**

#### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcinderella/projectcinderella.github.io/master/assets/images/Decisive.jpg" alt="Example" width="80" height="80"> Decisive
Her style is to **make a call and move on** with that decision. No U-turn and the idea is to chop chop curry pok so that we can all go down to have drinks! Your decisiveness in making tough decisions makes working under you a blessing.

> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__G9XEZhwM">My Way</a> ~ But through it all, when there was doubt ~ I ate it up and spit it out ~ I faced it all and I stood tall ~ And did it my way

#### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcinderella/projectcinderella.github.io/master/assets/images/No airs.jpg" alt="Example" width="80" height="80"> No Airs
She is unpretentious, not Hao Lian and Blink Blink or Blend Blend. **Always approachable** and willing to lend a listening ear to the people around her. A very down to earth person that makes you feel comfortable to be with.
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcinderella/projectcinderella.github.io/master/assets/images/singing.jpg" alt="Example" width="260" height="200"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcinderella/projectcinderella.github.io/master/assets/images/0112.jpg" alt="Example" width="220" height="200"></p>

#### SAP Finance Team

We learnt the term 's/he is bigger than life' without knowing the meaning.  That goes on, until we met you. 

<br>How can someone make her team overjoyed, give up lunches, burn night and day, risk their life to do your request?  How can someone get not-her team to feel at ease talking about SAP, systems, apps, even feel easier than talking to our own IT folks?  And when you say 'there is a feedback ah ...,', you make it sound as if it's a compliment.  This phenomenon is worth a one-term subject at NUS Social Science (wait, I'm calling a professor friend there).

<br>Back to this note, today is your birthday and it's our primary objective going to office (also a reason to decline meetings because we wouldn't miss it for the world).  

<br><strong>Therefore, here is for your day of the year. You're phenomenal!</strong>
